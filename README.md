# Porphyrin
The main aim of this project is using stk to build both free and metal based porphyrin chains and xtb to obtain the optimised structure and electronic properties. Then Keras - deep machine learning model to train our dataset and predict electronic properties of further configurations which are not considered in the constructed database.

# First part: building (stk) and optimisation (xtb)
- For loop is used to build all the porphyrin. Then
